 Ok, as the title says, this is my first \ official\ try at a mock draft, which I have been eager to do, since I feel that now I know a bit more about prospecting, team needs and the whole shenanigans. I am 100% sure that I will not be 100% right, but it feels as a nice exercise, and I'm more than happy to hear your thoughts on the below, even if is just to say that I made no sense. I have some rationale behind each pick/trade, but not every GM is recognized for thinking properly Inner Rhythm Meditations Vol II by BYRON METCALF (feat.

TRADE: OAK gives 4, 24, 2020 2nd to ARI for 1, 139.

Thanks to the Mack trade, the Raiders finally get their savior at QB. 2. SF selects DT Ed Oliver, Houston After his monstrous Pro Day, Oliver has cemented himself as the next Aaron Donald. He has huge pass rush upside and is the perfect.
